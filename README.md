# Blood Donor Finder App

The basic purpose of this app is to bring togther the donors and receivers of blood on the same platform so as to increase communication between them. Users can log in as donor or receiver. Even if someone doesn't need blood, he can register as a receiver and ask for blood on behalf of the one who actually needs it. The app sorts the donors depending on their proximity to the receiver. The proximity is calculated by GPS coordinates. 

Functionalities to be added:
* Better GUI.
* Push notifications -> Whenever, the receiver places a request to a particular donor, the donor should get a push notification. Whenever, the donor or receiver changes the status of their meeting from confirmed to cancelled, a push message should be sent to the other person. 
* Minor Bug Fixes.
